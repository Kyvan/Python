# Python
My stuff, or is it? it is tho

A small text based dungeon crawler. It is not the most efficient or best coded thing ever.
Your might last for a minute, or it might last for half an hour (I really did a piss poor job optimizing it, might get to fixing that later on when I have time)
All you need is python3 to run it and then possibly either enjoy it or curse me.
